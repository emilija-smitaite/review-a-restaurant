# The Alton Towers Foodie project
[View the live project here.](https://flask-review-a-restaurant.herokuapp.com/register)

This is a food review site for the Alton Towers theme park. The site is pointed at the theme park visitors. It helps to plan your visit based on the reviews and ratings of other visitors or to rate places that you have visited.
There currently 12 places to eat and snack at the resort, and all 12 are available to rate.
Developer would add a new Restaurant with the cover image whenever new one would open in the Alton Towers.

## Design

  #### **Colour scheme**

  - All the elements use Materialize native font stack which adapts to the device. These fonts are familiar to the user, professional and clean looking. 
  #### **Imagery**
  - Images only appear on All Reviews section, as a cover images for the Specific Restaurant. Images taken from the 
  Alton Towers official website[Theme Park](https://www.altontowers.com/explore/theme-park/restaurants-shops/), [CBeebies Land](https://www.altontowers.com/explore/cbeebies-land/restaurants-shops/).
  Every image is different apart from the two coffee shops.
